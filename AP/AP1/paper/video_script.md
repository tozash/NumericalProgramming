# 2-Minute Video Script: Vector and Matrix Norms

## Introduction (15 seconds)
We explore two fundamental norms: the 1-norm and infinity-norm for vectors, and their induced matrix norms. These norms measure distance and magnitude in different ways, revealing distinct geometric shapes.

## Definitions (30 seconds)
The 1-norm sums absolute values, while the infinity-norm takes the maximum absolute value. For matrices, the induced 1-norm is the maximum column sum, and the induced infinity-norm is the maximum row sum—these measure how much a matrix amplifies unit vectors.

## Visualization (45 seconds)
Our unit ball slices reveal the geometry: 1-norm creates diamonds, infinity-norm creates squares. For vectors, we see this in 2D slices; for matrices, we interpret them as 4-vectors and observe similar patterns using the induced norms.

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
These norms are essential in numerical linear algebra for understanding matrix conditioning, stability, and error propagation. The geometric intuition—diamonds versus squares—helps visualize how different norms weight coordinate errors differently.
